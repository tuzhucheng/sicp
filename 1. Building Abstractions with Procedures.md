# 1. Building Abstractions with Procedures

## 1.1 The Elements of Programming

### 1.1.1 Expressions

```Scheme
(+ 137 349)
```

* Numbers and primitive procedure (such as `+` or `*`) are all expressions.
* **Combinations** are expressions formed by delimiting a list of expressions within parentheses in order to denote procedure application.
* Leftmost element is *operator* and other elements are called *operands*.
* Note *prefix notation* is used, advantages include:
  * Arbitrary number of arguments:

  ```Scheme
  (+ 21 35 12)
  ```
  
  * Extends nicely to allow combinations to be nested:

  ```Scheme
  (+ (* 3 5) (- 10 6))
  ```

### 1.1.2 Naming and the Environment

* Define variables with `define`:

```Scheme
(define size 2)
```

* Can then use it like:

```Scheme
(* 5 size)
```

* Define is the simplest means of abstraction, by using simple names to refer to results of compound operations.
* Environment (global environment): memory that keeps track of name-object pairs.

### 1.1.3 Evaluating Combinations

* "Percolate values upward" is example of *tree accumulation*.
* Evaluation rules:
  * the values of numerals are the numbers that they name
  * the values of built-in operators are the machine instruction sequences that carry out the corresponding operations
  * the values of other names are the objects associated with those names in the environment
* Define is an exception to the general evaluation rule: they are called *special forms*.
* Various kinds of expressions, each with its associated evaluation rule, constitute the syntax of the programming language.
* Lisp has very simple syntax: simple general rule + specialized rules for small number of special forms.

### 1.1.4 Compound Procedures

* *Procedure definitions*: powerful abstraction technique by which a compound operation can be given a name and then referred to as a unit.

```Scheme
(define (square x) (* x x))
```
* This is a *compound procedure*.
* General form of *procedure definition*:

```Scheme
(define (<name> <formal parameters>) <body>)
```
* How to use it:

```Scheme
(square 21)
(square (square 3))
```
* Using existing procedures in other procedures:

```Scheme
(define (sum-of-squares x y)
  (+ (square x) (square y)))
```

### 1.1.5 The Substitution Model for Procedure Applications

* *Normal-order evaluation*: "fully expand and then reduce".
* *Applicative-order evaluation*: "evaluate the arguments and then apply".
* *Applicative-order evaluation* is more efficient and it is used by Lisp.

### 1.1.6 Conditional Expressions and Predicates

* Absolute value procedure:

```Scheme
(define (abs x)
  (cond ((> x 0) x)
    ((= x 0) 0)
    ((< x 0) (-x))))
```
* General form of conditional expression:

```Scheme
(cond (<p1> <e1>)
  (<p2> <e2>)
  ...
  (<pn> <en>))
```

* Each `(<p> <e>)` is called a *clause*. The first expression in of each pair is a *predicate*.
* If none is the predicates are found to be true, the value of `cond` is undefined.
* Alternative way to write absolute value procedure:

```Scheme
(define (abs x)
  (cond ((< x 0) -x)
    (else x)))
```

* Yet another way to write absolute value procedure:

```Scheme
(define (abs x)
  (if (< x 0)
    (-x)
    x))
```

* General form of `if` expression:

```Scheme
(if <predicate> <consequent> <alternative>)
```

* The three most frequently used compound predicates are:

```Scheme
(and <e1> ... <en>)
(or <e1> ... <en>)
(not <e>)
```

* Examples:

```Scheme
(and (> x 5) (< x 10))

(define (>= x y)
  (or (> x y) (= x y)))

(define (>= x y)
  (not (< x y)))
```
