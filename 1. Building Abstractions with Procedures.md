# 1. Building Abstractions with Procedures

## Expressions

```Scheme
(+ 137 349)
```

* Numbers and primitive procedure (such as `+` or `*`) are all expressions.
* **Combinations** are expressions formed by delimiting a list of expressions within parentheses in order to denote procedure application.
* Leftmost element is *operator* and other elements are called *operands*.
* Note *prefix notation* is used, advantages include:
  * Arbitrary number of arguments:

  ```Scheme
  (+ 21 35 12)
  ```
  
  * Extends nicely to allow combinations to be nested:

  ```Scheme
  (+ (* 3 5) (- 10 6))
  ```
