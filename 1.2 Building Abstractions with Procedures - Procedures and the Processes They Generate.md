### 1.2.1 Linear Recursion and Iteration

#### Linear Recursive Process

```Scheme
(define (factorial n)
  (if (= n 1)
     1
     (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
```

* *Deferred operations* (in this example a chain of multiplications).
* Expansions followed by contractions as operations are performed.
* Interpreter keeps track of operations to be performed later on.
* In general, this type of process characterized by *deferred operations* is a *recursive process*. In this case, the length of chain of deferred multiplications grows linearly with `n`.

#### Linear Iterative Process

```Scheme
(define (factorial n)
  (fact-iter 1 1 n))

(define (fact-iter product counter max-count)
  (if (> counter max-count)
    product
    (fact-iter (* counter product)
      (+ counter 1)
      max-count)))
```

* State can be summarized by finite number of *state variables*.
* Fixed rule that describes how state variables should be updated as process moves from state to state.
* Optional end test that specified conditions under which process should terminate.
* Generally, these are characteristics of *iterative process*. In this case, number of steps grows linearly with `n`.

* Recursive procedure: procedure definition refers to procedure itself syntactically.
* Recursive process: process evolves recursively, not related to syntax.
* `fact-iter` is a recursive procedure generating an iterative process.
* Most implementations of common programmming languages are such that the amount of memory grows proportionally with number of procedure calls for recursive procedures, even if process is iterative.
* Hence, the only way to describe iterative processes in these languages is through special "looping constructs" such as `for` and `while` loops.
* *Tail-recursive*: an implementation that will execute an iterative process in constant space, even if the process is described by a recursive procedure.
* With *tail-recursive* implementation, iteration can be described using ordinary procedure call mechanism.
